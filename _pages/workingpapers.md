Strategic Manipulation of Online Opinions: Implications for Startups and Investors (2021), with Fangzhou Lu
------
Startups are increasingly relying on online platforms to capture the attention of investors and attract users. 
Using data on venture capital deals and data from an online community of entreprenuers, we show that investors tend to 
relate their investment decisions to online opinions, and especially young and less experienced investors. Entrepreneurs are therefore 
tempted to manipulate investor perceptions by manufacturing comments that praise their products. Using COVID-19 as a 
positive shock to investor online presence, we examine the differences in online opinions for similar startup 
products before and after the pandemic. We argue that the net gains from manipulating online opinions are highest 
for entrepreneurs who are new to the online community, for startups in early stage, and for startups facing fierce 
competition. We demonstrate that startups with a high incentive to manipulate have more positive but less useful 
comments post-COVID relative to prior. Furthermore, our evidences do not support that investors are fooled by manipulation.

Inside the Black Box: Selection and Pricing of Fintech Mortgage Lenders (2020)
------
Fintech mortgage lenders who collect wide forms of borrower data entirely online and rely on
big data to make credit decisions through the use of machine learning algorithms have become an
increasingly important source of mortgage credit in the US. Compared to traditional lenders, Fintech
lenders are more likely to originate loans with high loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and particularly high
debt-to-income ratio (DTI), possibly working through greater loan size instead of lower income.
Conditional on predicted default rate using only observables, ex-post default rate is not significantly
differed whether the loan is originated by a Fintech or a traditional lender. Fintech loans get prepaid more often. They
get cross-subsidies in the to-be-announced mortgage-backed-securities market since
these loans are pooled together with low prepayment risk loans in the same contract. Fintech lenders also
set interest rates that are more sensitive to LTV but less sensitive to DTI, and consequently, their
interest rates have higher forecastability in prepayment but lower forecastability in delinquency
and default. The findings suggest that new technology might be able to identify credit risks at the
margin but may also be used to facilitate lenders in extracting rents.

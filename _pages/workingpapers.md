[Inside the Black Box: Selection and Pricing of Fintech Mortgage Lenders (2019)](https://yupenguu.github.io/files/typ_2019.pdf)
------
Fintech mortgage lenders who collect wide forms of borrower data entirely online and rely on
big data to make credit decisions through the use of machine learning algorithms have become an
increasingly important source of mortgage credit in the US. Compared to traditional lenders, Fintech
lenders are more likely to originate loans with high loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and particularly high
debt-to-income ratio (DTI), possibly working through greater loan size instead of lower income.
Conditional on predicted default rate using only observables, ex-post default rate is not significantly
differed whether the loan is originated by a Fintech or a traditional lender. Fintech lenders also
set interest rates that are more sensitive to LTV but less sensitive to DTI, and consequently, their
interest rates have higher forecastability in prepayment but lower forecastability in delinquency
and default. The findings suggest that new technology might be able to identify credit risks at the
margin but may also be used to facilitate lenders in extracting rents.

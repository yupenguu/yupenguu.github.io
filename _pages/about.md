I am a PhD candidate in the finance group at the MIT Sloan School of Management. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Information Systems and my master's degree in Finance from Tsinghua University.

My research interests center around entrepreneurial finance, household finance, and corporate governance, and financial technology.
